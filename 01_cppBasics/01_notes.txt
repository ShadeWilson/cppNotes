########## 1.1 ###############
Statements in C++ are terminated with a ; (dont forget!!)
All variables must be declared before they can be used

Helpful hint: Itâ€™s a good idea to put your main() function in
a .cpp file named either main.cpp, or with the same name as your project.
For example, if you are writing a Chess game, you could put your main()
function in chess.cpp.

One of the most commonly used parts of the C++ standard library is
is the iostream library, which contains functionality to write/read
to/from the screen

Compile and run helloWorld:
shadewilson $ g++ -o helloWorld helloWorld.cpp
shadewilson $ ./helloWorld
